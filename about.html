<p>We are DOG-GONE&#8482;, established in 2006 as a fun way to make quick cash 
while doing what we love: turning alive dogs into dead dogs.</p>
<p>It started when Gerald and I became tired of our beloved pet Italian 
Greyhound: Evan. One day, after Evan left tracks into the house, my husband 
Gerald said he had enough.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">He brought Evan out back, kicked him in his own ass, and 
blew that fuckers head right off !!!</p>
<p class="auto-style1">AFter this, we locked eyes and knew where our future 
lied. We had struck gold, it was a sign from GOD - the Christian one. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">God wanted us to kill dogs, and that is what we have been 
doing at a steady rate, with returning customers, and groundbreaking service.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have always provided the best service that will give competitors a run for 
they're money. Want your precious little angel stabbed? strangled? fucking 
drowned in the river?</p>
<p class="auto-style3">you have come to the right place.</p>
<p class="auto-style4">DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT FOR SEXUAL GAIN, BUT HEY - IT'S A 
PRETTY GOOD TIME. WE BREAK A SWEAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE LIKE WHAT WE 
DO.</p>
<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Here is a picture of both of us:</p>
